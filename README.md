# Image-Processing-Techniques

This project focuses on implementing various image processing techniques using Python, with a particular emphasis on sharpening and blurring algorithms. The project leverages libraries such as OpenCV and NumPy to perform operations on images. Additionally, convolution kernels are applied for tasks like edge enhancement and noise reduction. Extensive experimentation has been conducted to optimize the results.
